VJing Toolkit in a browser.

This is the initial code, mostly written during live performances, that originated the project.

Because of the very nature of live coding, and the fact that the code is written on top of a primarily
'naked' browser, you'll find it is rather sloppy code and there are many things that could be optimized
and improved.

Hopefully the new toolkit will be more polished, performant and generic.
